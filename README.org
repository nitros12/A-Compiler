#+TITLE: A-Compiler

* Description
This is the repo of my programming language.

The main target of the compiler is my [[https://github.com/nitros12/A-VM][virtual machine]] but I plan to also use
[[https://github.com/Maratyszcza/PeachPy][PeachPy]] at some point to produce x86_64 binaries and also a LLVM backend
eventually.

[[file:compiler/parser]] contains the language definition of my language
[[file:compiler/objects]] contains the AST nodes and IR generator
