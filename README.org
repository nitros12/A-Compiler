#+TITLE: A-Compiler

* Description
This is the repo of my programming language.

The main target of the compiler is my [[https://github.com/nitros12/A-VM][virtual machine]] but I plan to also use
[[https://github.com/Maratyszcza/PeachPy][PeachPy]] at some point to produce x86_64 binaries and also a LLVM backend
eventually.

[[file:compiler/parser]] contains the language definition of my language
[[file:compiler/objects]] contains the AST nodes and IR generator

* Running

To run programs, install this package and run the program ~wewcompile~.

Use pip to install rather than running setup.py as I've found ~python setup.py install~ to not copy necessary non-python files
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install -U .
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
wewcompile examples/fibonacci.wew program.bin
#+END_SRC

To run a program, use the [[https://github.com/nitros12/A-VM][virtual machine]] to execute the program.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cargo run -- program.bin
#+END_SRC
